1. As a game player, I want to hear an audio cue that indicates my typing accuracy
   so I have feedback on my performance.
2. As a student, I wnat to have a way to track my progress over time, so that I know
   what aspects of my typing I need to improve on.
3. As an advanced user, I want to remap the keyboard, so I can practice different
   layouts.
